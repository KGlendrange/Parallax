### Parallax effect

The parallax effect is when the background moves at a different speed than the content in the foreground. This creates an illusion of depth.

I tried to do that with the trees in the background and the rocks, and then I added a surfer every so often and some elements moving when you scroll.

Seems like animation on scrolling is the main interaction from a simple story telling perspective.
